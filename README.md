# What is SOS?
SOS is a game that has many similarities to the infamous tic tac toe
In SOS you have two game modes General and Simple
General Game Mode the goal is to match more SOS's by the time the matrix is filled up than your opponent
Simple Game Mode the goal is to be the first to match one SOS
My version has 3 opponent styles Player Vs. Player, Player Vs. Robot, and Robot Vs. Robot
There is a unique recording implementation that can play the game step by step afterwards if you hit record before starting
